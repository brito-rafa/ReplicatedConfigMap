# Replicated Config Map

This is a "toy" K8s controller to demonstrate how to build a cluster-level CRD and a controller using Kubebuilder 3.x.
This controller will take a Replicated Config Map (aka rcm) cluster-level object and create on many namespaces.

## Description

This controller synchronizes ConfigMap resources to multiple namespaces from a cluster scoped CRD named ReplicatedConfigMap.
The ReplicatedConfigMap CRs contain a "data" map which is synchronized to ConfigMapis in each namespace that has the label "rcm-sync: true".
ReplicatedConfigMap CR name is used for the Config Maps name on each namespace.
Updates and deletes to the ReplicatedConfigMap are also be propagated out to the ConfigMap in each namespace.

## TL;DR Deploying the Controller

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

Run:

```sh
export IMG=quay.io/brito_rafa0/rcm-controller:latest
make deploy 

# check the controller
kubectl get pods -n rcm-system

# install Sample CR
kubectl create -f config/samples/sample-data.yaml 
```


### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
	
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/rcm:tag
```
	
3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/rcm:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster 

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
